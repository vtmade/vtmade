## Features

- Algorithm-to-art transformation
- Visual narrative generation
- Code as creative medium
- Experimental visualizations

## Philosophy

Making code dance, as described in the article ["When I Decided to Make Code Dance"](https://linkedin.com/pulse/when-decided-make-code-dance-my-ardcode-experiment-vinay-thakur-ucwyf).
